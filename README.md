Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
    -Software engineering is the art of identifying a real life problem them you computerise it and develop a computerised solution.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  -1940-1950: Early computer programming: Early computers were being programmed manually. Assembly language and high early languages were being used
  -1968:Birth of Software and NATO conference:  This was when the term 'software engineering' was formalized and addressed the software crisis.
  -1970:Waterfall Model: Winston Royce, proposed the waterfall model and it became the first defined software development lifecycle model.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  -Requirement analysis: project goals and system requirements are difined by gathering information from stakeholders. Identifying end user needs, documenting system requiremnts and defining project scope and objectives.
  -Design: the requirements are collected together and designed how the system will be.
  -Coding: The system is being coded based on the specificaions. the system is broken down into smaller module and each module is coded individually.
  -Testing: The system is tested after implementation to identify bugs and fix them and modules intergarated together.
  -Deployment: If testing goes on well the system is deployed and released to the end user.
  -maintanance: Post-deployyment, the software enters the maintanance phase to update and improve where needed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  -Wterfall approach the whole process of software development divided into separate phases, the output of one phase act as the input for the following phase. It can be used where Requirements are fixed or the budget is very strict.
  -Agile project are broken down into small, manageble sprints or iterations. It can be used to a project that has evolving requiremnts or a high inovation project.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  -A software developer is responsible for: 
    1. Coding and develpment.
    2. Analysing requirements.
    3. Designing and architecture.
    4. Testing and debugging.
    5. Documenting.
    6. Collaborating with others.
  -A Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for ensuring the quality and functionality of a software through serious testing.
  - A project manager oversees the project progress from start to finish, co-ordinating all all team activities.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  -IDEs Simpify the development process by intergrating all the essential tools developers need into a single application. They iclude code editors, debuggers, compilers. eg. VS code, Code Block
  -VCS allows developers to work with other develper on one project or sharing ideas. They also maintain historical record of code changes, facilitating collaboration and prevemting conflict among developers.They include GIT, Subversion.
  


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
   - Debugging: identifying bugd sometimes might be a serious challenge and can be coped by breaking down the problem, using systematic debugging techniques and documenting solutions.
   - Staying updated with technology: Technology is constantly changing and advancing with new features everyday and sometimes you migh find yourself behind technology this can be handled by learning new things everyday, participating in communities and building strong foundation in core programming.
   - Time management: sometimesyou might find yourself behind the required period this can de managed byy priotizing important tasks and breaking down goals into smaller tasks.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  -Unit intergration: involves testing individual component and intergarate them with others. 
  It helps to identify interface errors like mismached data and correct them.
  -System testin: Involves testing the whole sytem or program after intergration. It reveals issues that only emerge when all components interact under real-world condition.
  -Acceptance testing: It tests wheteher the software meets the user needs and is ready for deployment. I t helps to verify that the software meets their needs and behaves as expected in real-world scenario.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  - This is the disigning of texts carefully used to communicate with AI models. It helps in getting clarity from a point that you dont understand.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Programming     Improved prompt: Tell me about programming, what its all about and why we need programming in our society.
  -Improved prompt is affective because it makes a point clear and make the AI model to give you the best feedback possible.
